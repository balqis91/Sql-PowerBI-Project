## ✅ Database Schema  

**Students Table**
- `StudentID` (Primary Key)  
- `Name`  
- `Age`  
- `Grade`  
- `TeachersID` (Foreign Key → Teachers)  
- `Score`  
- `ScoreGrade`  

**Teachers Table**
- `TeachersID` (Primary Key)  
- `Name`  
- `Subject`  

**Relationship**  
- One Teacher → Many Students

BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Students (Name, Age, Grade, TeachersID, Score, ScoreGrade)
    VALUES (p_name, p_age, p_grade, p_teachersID, p_score, p_scoreGrade);
    SET p_studentID = LAST_INSERT_ID();
END;
CREATE FUNCTION Calculate_Discount (
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    discount_percent DECIMAL(5,2)
)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10,2)
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    DECLARE discounted_price DECIMAL(10,2);
    SET discounted_price = price - (price * discount_percent / 100);
    RETURN discounted_price;
END;
